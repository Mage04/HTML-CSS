                        The wait for the next Marvel Cinematic Universe movie just got even longer. According to The Hollywood Reporter,
                        Disney has delayed several upcoming projects including the three upcoming MCU films: Black Widow,
                         Eternals and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.<br><br>
       
                       Black Widow, which was first supposed to come out in summer this year and was delayed to November, 
                       will now be released on May 7, 2021.
                       
                       Eternals, which was going to be released in November 2020 originally, will now hit theaters on November on 5, 2021.<br>
                       Finally, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is scheduled to be released on July 9, 2021. 
                       It was earlier hitting theaters on May 7, 2021, the date on which Black Widow will now release.

                <div class="col-4">
                    Black Widow is based on the only female superhero in the old guard of the Avengers. Since,
                    Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow is now deceased after her sacrifice in Avengers: Endgame, this film is set in the past.
                     Specifically, it is set after the events of 2016’s Captain America.<br><br> Civil War, in which she finds herself on the run from
                      the law thanks to her aid to Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes.
                   
                   Eternals is a multi-starrer that would explore the titular alien immortals who have stood in opposition 
                   to Deviants like Thanos (at least in the comics) for millions of years. The film, directed by Chloé Zhao and
                    written by Matthew and Ryan Firpo, stars Richard Madden, Gemma Chan, Kumail Nanjiani, Lauren Ridloff, Brian Tyree Henry,
                     Salma Hayek, Lia McHugh, Don Lee, Barry Keoghan, Angelina Jolie and Kit Harington.
