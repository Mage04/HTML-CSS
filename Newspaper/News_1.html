    Rashid Khan mesmerised with his spin while David Warner’s captaincy was superb. 
    A slow Abu Dhabi pitch notwithstanding, Sunrisers Hyderabad were defending just about a par total.
     They had little margin for error, especially after two losses in their first two games. 
     The Rashid-Warner combo helped Sunrisers secure their first win in this IPL. Their victory margin, 15 runs, 
     though, doesn’t tell the whole story.<br> <br>

Sunrisers’ efforts were even more laudable for the fact that they bowled second and had to counter the dew. 
From the experienced Bhuvneshwar Kumar to young Abhishek Sharma, everybody stood up to be counted. 
But Rashid was the x-factor, while his captain was the mastermind.<br><br></div>

        <h6>14 day quarantine ahead of three Asian leg tournaments in January 2021</h6><br>
        Bangkok, Thailand will enforce a 14-day strict quarantine on international shuttlers heading there for the three Asian
         leg tournaments in January 2021.<br>


The Badminton World Federation in a virtual press briefing insisted that while the sport has struggled to take off, 
badminton is keen on pulling off the two Asian circuit events and the World Tour finals by stitching up a tight bubble.
 A mandatory Covid-19 test from point of origin certifying them fit to fly, and another at the Bangkok airport 
 is part of the protocol for players. For 14 days, all participants and their entourage will be hemmed inside the
  designated bubble hotel during which they will be tested several times.<br>

While Olympic qualification will try to stick to its April 30, 2020 deadlines, the situation remains fluid, BWF said.<br>

    <h6>Trial of battery-operated masks on athletes to ensure intense training amid Covid-19 threat</h6><br>

    Claiming to be the best in ensuring optimum oxygen for the wearer, battery-operated masks designed by an IIT-Kharagpur alumni will be put on trial for India’s Olympic-bound athletes by the IOA to assist their intense training. The IOA has tied up with IIT Kharagpur’s Piyush Agarwal, who currently owns a startup ‘PQR Technology Private Limited’ 
    and has got government funding under the ‘KAWACH Mask Project’. His start-up is currently attached with IIT Delhi.<br>

<h6>Leroy Sane to miss Bayern Munich’s DFL-Supercup, confirms Hansi Flick</h6><br>

Bayern Munich winger Leroy Sane will miss Wednesday’s domestic Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund with a
 knee injury while defender David Alaba is doubtful, coach Hansi Flick said on Tuesday.<br>

Bayern, who won four titles this year, lost Sunday’s league game at Hoffenheim 4-1 to suffer their first defeat of 2020.<br>

“Leroy is out. He will most likely be out until and will return after the break for international matches (between Oct. 7-13),” 

Flick told reporters.<br>
The Bavarians almost played through the summer with no real pre-season preparation as they lifted the Champions League in August.
 They also beat Sevilla last week in the European Super Cup to secure their fourth trophy after also winning the German league and Cup.<br>
