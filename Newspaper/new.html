                 will prohibit US travelers from staying at properties owned by the Cuban government," </i>
                Trump said at a White House event. We're also further restricting the importation of alcohol and Cuban tobacco.<br><br>

                The speech represented a clear effort by Trump to court Cuban American voters, who make up a key sector of 
                Latino voters in Florida, Polls show Trump locked in a tight battle with Biden in Florida, which has the largest 
                Cuban American population of all the U.S. states. <br><br>

                “This is a desperate and hypocritical attempt by Trump to pander to Cuban-American voters in Florida,” 
                Enrique Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Democratic Party said in an email. “American citizens are already banned 
                from traveling to Cuba because of the coronavirus.”
            Mr. Gutierrez said that Mr. Trump was “using our foreign policy for his own political gain.”

            Cuba is currently closed to foreign travelers because of the coronavirus pandemic, 
            but when it opens, American citizens will be banned from lodging at 433 hotels funded by the
             Cuban government ”  owned and operated by “legitimately independent entrepreneurs.
             “It is a wrong policy that is widely rejected by American society and even among Cuban Americans”<br>
